EditProfile.jsx — Very detailed guide for absolute beginners

File path: `frontend/src/components/EditProfile.jsx`

What this file does (plain language)
- This file shows a small form where a user can change their public profile details: name, short bio, and profile picture (avatar). When the user clicks Save, these changes are sent to the server to be stored.

Think of it like editing your business card:
- Name and bio are like the text on the card.
- Avatar is the small photo stuck to the card.

Step-by-step: what happens when a user edits their profile
1) The page shows your current data
   - When you open the edit form, it fills the input fields with your current name and bio and shows your current avatar.

2) You change fields or pick a new image
   - For text fields (name, bio) you simply type.
   - For avatar: you click a file picker and choose a picture from your computer.
   - The code usually shows an immediate preview of the picture (so you can confirm it looks OK).

3) You click Save
   - The app may first upload the image to a file hosting service (Cloudinary) and get back a web address for the image.
   - Then the app sends a small request to the server like: "Update my profile: new name is X, new bio is Y, avatar URL is Z".

4) Server stores the new values and replies with the updated user object
   - The app updates the user information shown in the whole site (header, profile, posts) using a central place called Redux (a shared memory for the app).

Technical shapes (what the data looks like)
- Input values: simple strings, e.g. name = "Alex Doe", bio = "Photographer".
- Avatar upload: file → server returns URL string: "https://res.cloudinary.com/..../avatar.jpg".
- Final update request body example (JSON):
  { "name": "Alex Doe", "bio": "New bio", "avatar": "https://...jpg" }

Common beginner questions answered
- Q: "Do I need to upload a picture?"
  A: No, text changes can be saved without changing the avatar.
- Q: "Why does the app upload the picture before sending the profile update?"
  A: The image must be hosted somewhere with a public link so that other people can see it. Uploading returns that public link so the server can save it.
- Q: "Why does the whole app update after I save?"
  A: Because the user's data is stored in a shared place (Redux). When we update that shared place, every component that shows the user's name or avatar automatically shows the new value.

Edge cases and how the code usually defends against them
- The user picks a huge image: the form should reject files over a size limit (e.g., 5MB).
- Network failure during upload: show an error and allow retry.
- Invalid file type (not an image): show a message asking the user to select an image file.

How to test these features (step-by-step for non-coders)
1. Open the app and go to your profile; click Edit Profile.
2. Change only the name, click Save — the header should change to the new name across the app.
3. Change only the avatar: choose a small image (e.g., 200x200 px) and Save — after upload completes the new avatar should appear.
4. Try selecting a very large file (>10MB). The app should reject it or show an error message.

Security note (simple)
- The app should never expose secret API keys in the browser. If the app uploads directly to a service like Cloudinary, it should use a safe, non-secret way (signed or unsigned upload presets) as recommended by the provider.

Where to look in the code
- The component usually uses `useState` to keep local form values and `axios` to call API endpoints.
- The upload step may call a small helper in `utils/cloudinary.js` which abstracts how files are uploaded.
