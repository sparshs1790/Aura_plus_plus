Explore.jsx — Beginner-friendly walkthrough

File path: frontend/src/components/Explore.jsx
Purpose: The Explore page helps users discover public content outside their normal feed. It typically shows trending posts, search results, or a grid of recommended media.

What a non-coder sees
- A large grid of images or posts, often with filters or a search bar.

How it works step-by-step
1) The component calls the backend to fetch trending or recommended posts.
2) The posts are displayed in a grid. Clicking a post opens the Comment dialog.
3) There may be sorting or filtering controls (popular, recent).

Why explore is separate from feed
- Feed shows posts from people you follow; Explore shows public content to help you find new people and topics.

Testing steps
1. Open Explore and confirm it shows posts.
2. Use filters or sorting, if available, and confirm the grid updates.
3. Click a post and ensure comment dialog opens.

Developer notes
- Explore often uses server-side ranking and may include pagination or infinite scroll.
- For performance, lazy-load images and consider using a CDN.
