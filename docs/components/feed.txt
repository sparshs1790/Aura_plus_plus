Feed.jsx — Beginner-friendly explanation

File path: frontend/src/components/Feed.jsx
Purpose: Displays the main timeline of posts — fetches posts from the backend, stores them in Redux or local state, and renders `Posts` component. Handles refresh and pagination.

High-level responsibilities
- Fetch all posts (or posts of followed users) from the API when the component mounts.
- Provide refresh control to re-fetch posts.
- Store the posts in Redux so other components can access them (like Post and CommentDialog).

--- Imports commonly used ---
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import Posts from './Posts'
import axios from 'axios'
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import { setPosts } from '@/redux/postSlice'

--- Component behavior ---
1. On mount: useEffect(() => { fetchPosts() }, [])
2. fetchPosts: GET request to `/api/v1/post/all` or similar endpoint. On success, dispatch(setPosts(data.posts)).
3. Render: <Posts posts={posts} /> where `posts` comes from Redux via useSelector.

--- Optimizations ---
- Debounce polling or add a websocket (Socket.io) for real-time updates.
- Add pagination or infinite scroll: keep page number in state and fetch more on scroll.

--- Error handling ---
- If fetch fails, show a friendly message and optionally a Retry button.

--- Testing checklist ---
- Mock API to return a known list; ensure Feed fetches and dispatches actions to populate Redux.
- Ensure Posts receives updated posts when Redux state changes.

--- UX notes ---
- Show a spinner or skeleton while posts are loading.
- Add pull-to-refresh on mobile if required.
