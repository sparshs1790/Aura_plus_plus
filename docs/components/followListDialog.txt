FollowListDialog — Beginner-friendly explanation

File path: frontend/src/components/FollowListDialog.jsx
Purpose: A modal dialog that shows a list of users who follow the current user or who the current user is following. Users can click on entries to open profiles, and follow/unfollow from within the dialog.

What the user sees
- A pop-up dialog with a scrollable list of users including avatar, name, and a follow/unfollow button next to each name.

How it works in plain steps
1) The dialog fetches or receives a list of users to display (followers or following).
2) It renders that list with small clickable rows.
3) The Follow button sends a request to the server and updates the label locally.

Why use a dialog
- It provides a quick way to view followers without navigating away from the current page.

Testing steps
1. Open the followers list from a profile and confirm it shows the correct users.
2. Click a user to open their profile in a new page or overlay.
3. Click Follow/Unfollow and confirm the button updates and the server request returns success.

Developer notes
- Use virtualization for very large lists to maintain performance.
- Ensure the dialog handles empty states gracefully: show "No followers yet" when list is empty.
