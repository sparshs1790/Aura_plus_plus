Home.jsx — Beginner-friendly explanation

File path: frontend/src/components/Home.jsx
Purpose: The top-level view that composes the main layout of the app's home page: left sidebar, feed (center), and right sidebar. It wires together `Feed`, `SuggestedBox`, `RightSideBar`, and possibly `CreatePost`.

High-level responsibilities
- Compose layout and arrange the primary sections.
- Handle responsive behavior: move sidebars below or hide them on small screens.
- Provide top-level actions like creating a post or opening a modal.

Typical imports
- LeftSideBar, RightSideBar, Feed, CreatePost, SuggestedBox, Posts
- useSelector to read logged-in user

Layout notes
- Common pattern: three-column layout on large screens:
  - left column: navigation (LeftSideBar)
  - center column: Feed
  - right column: suggestions and trending (RightSideBar / SuggestedBox)

Implementation details
- Use CSS grid or flexbox with Tailwind for responsive columns: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4` then set the center column to span 2 on medium screens: `md:col-span-2`.
- The home page often wires `CreatePost` at the top of the Feed so users can post quickly.

State & data flow
- Home typically doesn't fetch posts itself; `Feed` does that. Home passes small props (like current user) to sidebars.

Testing and debugging
- Ensure layout collapses gracefully on small screens (Left/Right hidden or placed below the main feed).
- Verify that clicking "Create Post" opens the `CreatePost` component/modal and that feed refreshes after posting.

Accessibility & UX
- Ensure keyboard focus is handled when a modal opens (trap focus inside the CreatePost modal).
- For long pages, provide skip-links for accessibility to jump to the main feed.
