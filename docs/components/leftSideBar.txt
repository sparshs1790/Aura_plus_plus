LeftSideBar.jsx — Beginner-friendly guide

File path: frontend/src/components/LeftSideBar.jsx
Purpose: Renders the main navigation for the app: links to Home, Explore, Messages, Profile, and other primary pages.

What a non-coder sees
- A vertical list of icons and labels on the left side of the screen. Clicking a label navigates to that page.

What the code does (step-by-step)
1) Shows static navigation items (Home, Explore, Messages, Profile).
2) Highlights the active route so the user knows where they are.
3) Optionally shows a small avatar and a quick link to the current user's profile.

Why it's useful
- Keeps navigation consistent across the app so users can move between main sections quickly.

How to test
1. Click each navigation link and confirm you are taken to the correct page.
2. Resize the browser to verify the sidebar is hidden or collapses on small screens.

Developer notes
- Use `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` to automatically get an active state.
- Keep the component simple — it should only render links and not fetch heavy data.
