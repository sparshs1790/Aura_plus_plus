Login.jsx — Step-by-step guide for absolute beginners

File path: `frontend/src/components/Login.jsx`

What this file does (plain language)
- Shows a small form where returning users enter their email and password to sign into the app. After a successful sign-in, the app remembers the user so they can use protected features.

What the user sees
- Fields for email (or username) and password, and a Login button.
- Optionally a "Remember me" checkbox and a link to reset password.

Step-by-step: what happens when someone logs in
1) The user types email and password
	- These are simple text boxes. The code may hide the password characters while typing for privacy.

2) The user clicks Login
	- The browser sends an HTTP POST request to the server: "I want to log in with this email and password".

3) The server checks the credentials
	- If correct, the server returns a token (a secret string used to authenticate future requests) and user information.
	- If incorrect, the server returns an error like "Invalid credentials".

4) The app stores the token and user
	- The token is stored in a safe place (Redux or localStorage, or preferably an httpOnly cookie set by the server).
	- The app then navigates the user to the main page (Feed/Home).

Why tokens exist (simple explanation)
- Tokens are like a wristband you get at an event: once you have it, the app knows you are allowed to access restricted pages without asking for the password again.

Common problems and what they mean
- Wrong password message → The user typed incorrect credentials.
- No network → The login request couldn't reach the server; check your internet or server status.

How to test the Login flow (step-by-step for beginners)
1. Open the Login page.
2. Enter a valid email and password that exists in your database and click Login. You should be redirected to the home page.
3. Try entering a wrong password; the page should show a clear error message.

Security tips for maintainers (short)
- When possible, use server-set httpOnly cookies for tokens to reduce XSS risk.
- Avoid logging plaintext passwords; only send them over HTTPS.
