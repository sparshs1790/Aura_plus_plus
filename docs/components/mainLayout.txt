MainLayout.jsx — Beginner-friendly walkthrough and examples

File path: `frontend/src/components/MainLayout.jsx`

What this file is (plain words)
- This is the "frame" that wraps every page of the app. Imagine a website with a header at the top, a menu on the left, content in the middle, and suggestions on the right — `MainLayout` builds that consistent frame so every page looks and behaves the same.

What a non-coder should expect visually
- A top header (logo, search, profile avatar).
- Left navigation (links to Home, Explore, Messages).
- The middle area where pages like Feed, Profile, or Messages appear.
- A right column for extras (suggested users, trending topics).

How it works step-by-step (no coding knowledge required)
1) The layout is always rendered around page content
  - The router (the part that chooses which page to show) places the page content inside `MainLayout`.

2) The header and sidebars are independent pieces
  - Header, LeftSideBar and RightSideBar are separate components (like separate widgets). The layout places them in fixed positions.

3) Responsive behavior (what happens on small screens)
  - On small screens, the left or right sidebars may be hidden or collapsed to give more space to the main content. The layout uses CSS rules (Tailwind) to handle this automatically.

Simple analogy
- Think of a newspaper: the masthead (header) is at the top, the main column is the center, and sidebars are like the small opinion or ad columns. `MainLayout` arranges these fixed regions.

Common tasks you might do here (for maintainers)
- Add a global notification area (toast container) so messages appear in the same place across all pages.
- Initialize a websocket (Socket.io) here so every page can use real-time features like messages or live notifications.

Accessibility notes (simple)
- Add a skip-to-content link at the top so keyboard users can jump directly to the main content.
- Ensure header and sidebar links have good focus outlines and aria-labels.

How to test layout behavior (beginner-friendly)
1. Open different pages (Home, Profile, Messages) and confirm the header and left menu always stay visible.
2. Resize the browser window to a small width and confirm the sidebars collapse and content remains usable.

Technical tip for maintainers (short)
- The layout often uses a CSS grid like `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-4` to create the columns. The main content usually spans the middle columns (e.g., `md:col-span-2`).
