NotificationToast — Beginner-friendly guide

File path: frontend/src/components/NotificationToast.jsx or ui/sonner wrapper
Purpose: Small non-blocking pop-up messages that appear briefly to inform the user of success, errors, or important info (e.g., "Post uploaded", "Message sent").

What the user sees
- A small box near the top-right (or bottom) of the screen showing text for a few seconds.

How it works (simple)
1) Some code triggers a toast (e.g., after a successful API response the code calls toast.success("Saved"))
2) The toast library shows a small floating message on screen that disappears automatically after a short time.

Why toasts are useful
- They give feedback without interrupting the user's flow (no modal dialogs required).

Testing steps
1. Perform an action that should show a toast (e.g., save a post) and confirm the message appears.
2. Confirm important messages can be dismissed or persist if configured.

Developer notes
- The project uses `sonner` (or similar) — wrap it once at the app root using a provider.
- Keep toast messages concise and avoid displaying technical errors directly to users.
