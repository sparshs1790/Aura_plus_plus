Posts.jsx — Beginner-friendly explanation

File path: frontend/src/components/Posts.jsx
Purpose: Renders a list of `Post` components (the feed or a user's profile gallery). Handles layout, empty states and passing data to each `Post`.

Overview
- `Posts` receives a `posts` array via props or reads from Redux store. It maps over the array and renders `<Post post={singlePost} />` for each item.
- Also handles pagination or infinite scroll in more advanced versions.

Typical props
- posts: array of post objects
- isProfile?: boolean (if true, render a profile-specific layout)

--- Key parts ---
1. imports
- React, Post component, maybe Skeleton loaders for loading state.

2. Conditional rendering
- If posts.length === 0 → show empty state: "No posts yet" with a nice graphic.

3. Mapping
- posts.map((post) => <Post key={post._id} post={post} />)
- Use unique key prop to help React track list items.

4. Layout
- Grid or vertical feed depending on screen size. Uses Tailwind classes like `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` for responsive layout.

--- Edge cases ---
- When a post is deleted from the feed, ensure the component re-renders with updated posts from Redux.
- When posts are still loading, show skeleton placeholders instead of an empty state.
- Beware mutating the posts array; always use immutable updates so React notices changes.

--- Testing ---
- Provide a short posts array and render `Posts` to confirm it renders one `Post` per item.
- Test empty array and loading states.

--- Integration ---
- `Feed.jsx` typically fetches posts from API and passes them to `Posts`.
- `Profile.jsx` filters posts for a single user and passes them to `Posts` for the grid view.
