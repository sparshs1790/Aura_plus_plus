Profile.jsx — Beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide for non-coders

File path: `frontend/src/components/Profile.jsx`

Goal (in plain words)
- This file builds the "Profile" page you see when you visit someone's page (for example: your page or a friend's page). Think of the profile page like a personal public page that shows who the person is and their pictures.

What a non-coder should expect to see on the screen
- A large avatar (profile picture) and the user's display name.
- Buttons like "Follow" (if you're not the owner) or "Edit Profile" (if the page is yours).
- Counts for Posts, Followers and Following.
- A grid or list of their posts (photos/videos). You can click a post to open the comments dialog.

How the code makes that happen — simple step-by-step
1) Read the profile ID from the page URL
  - The app's address bar contains the ID of the profile you want to view, for example `/profile/123`.
  - The code uses a small helper (useParams) to read `123` from the URL.

2) Ask the backend for profile information
  - The code asks the server: "Give me the profile for ID = 123". The server returns a JSON object with fields like name, avatar (image URL), bio, followers list, and posts (or post IDs).
  - Example server response shape (simple):
    {
     _id: "123",
     name: "Alex Doe",
     avatar: "https://.../alex.jpg",
     bio: "Photographer",
     followers: ["u1","u2"],
     posts: [{_id: 'p1', image: '...' }, ...]
    }

3) Store the profile in the component's memory
  - The code keeps the received profile in a local box (called state) so the page can show the values.

4) Show the profile header (avatar, name, stats)
  - The header is simple markup that reads values from the local box and renders them on screen.

5) Show actions: Follow / Unfollow / Edit
  - If the viewer is the same person as the profile owner, the page shows "Edit Profile".
  - If the viewer is a different user, it shows "Follow" or "Unfollow" depending on whether they already follow the user.
  - Clicking Follow sends a small request to the backend and then updates the follower count on screen.

6) Show posts or bookmarks
  - The page usually has two tabs: "Posts" and "Bookmarks". Tabs are just buttons that tell the page which list to show.
  - When the user clicks a picture, the post opens the comment dialog (the same dialog we documented earlier).

Simple analogies to help understand (no coding experience needed)
- Think of the profile page as a physical photo album on a table: the header is the album cover (name, photo), the counts are stickers on the cover, and the grid of images is the album pages.
- The code simply reads the album's ID, fetches the photos, and places them on the table for display.

Common problems and plain solutions
- "Nothing appears" → The server didn't return any data. Check internet or make sure the profile ID exists.
- "No posts shown" → The user might not have any posts; show a friendly empty message like "No posts yet".
- "Follow button does not change" → The follow request may have failed — try again or check for error messages.

How to test the Profile page (step-by-step, beginner-friendly)
1. Open the app and go to the URL `/profile/<some-user-id>` (replace with a real id from your database).
2. Confirm you can see the user's avatar, name, and counts.
3. If you are another user: click Follow — the follower count should increase by one and the button should change to Unfollow.
4. If you are the owner: click Edit Profile and change your name or avatar. After saving, confirm the header shows the new values.

Technical notes for future editors (short)
- The component often uses `axios` to call the API and `useEffect` to run the fetch when the page loads.
- Posts may be returned as full objects or as IDs — if they are IDs the page may need to resolve them to full posts before rendering.
