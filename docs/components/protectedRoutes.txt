ProtectedRoutes.jsx — Beginner-friendly guide

File path: frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoutes.jsx
Purpose: Ensures only logged-in users can access certain pages (like Feed, Messages, Profile editing). If a user is not logged in, it redirects them to the Login page.

What a non-coder sees
- If you're not logged in and try to visit a protected page, the app sends you to the Login screen.
- If you are logged in, you see the page normally.

Simple step-by-step
1) The app checks if there is an authenticated user (usually in Redux or a cookie).
2) If a user exists, the ProtectedRoutes component renders the requested page.
3) If not, it redirects to `/login`.

Why protected routes are needed
- Some pages should only be visible to registered users (messages, posting, editing). This prevents unauthorized access.

Testing steps for non-coders
1. Log out and try to visit `/messages` — you should be redirected to `/login`.
2. Log in, then visit `/messages` — now you should be able to access it.

Developer notes
- Use `useSelector` to check `store.auth.user` or similar.
- Protect routes on the server too — the client check is UX level, server must enforce permissions.
