RightSideBar.jsx — Beginner-friendly guide

File path: frontend/src/components/RightSideBar.jsx
Purpose: Shows secondary information and suggestions: suggested users to follow, trending topics, and small widgets that enrich the main feed.

What a non-coder sees
- A column on the right with "Suggested" people, maybe a small list of trending hashtags, and occasional small ads or tips.

Step-by-step explanation
1) The component receives or fetches lightweight data (suggested users, trending items).
2) Renders small cards or lists with each item and a Follow button for suggested users.
3) Clicking a suggested user takes you to their profile.

Why separate right-side content
- Keeps the main feed focused while still showing helpful extras. It's intentionally less interactive and used for discovery.

Testing steps
1. Ensure suggested users display names and avatars.
2. Click a suggested user and confirm the profile opens.
3. Click Follow and see the UI update to show the follow happened.

Developer notes
- Keep server calls minimal and cache suggestions if possible.
- Small performance benefit: right-side widgets can load lazily so the main feed loads faster.
