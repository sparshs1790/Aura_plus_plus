SearchBox.jsx — Beginner-friendly explanation

File path: frontend/src/components/SearchBox.jsx
Purpose: Small UI control used to search users or posts. Often appears in the header or explore page.

What a non-coder sees
- An input box with placeholder text like "Search". Typing yields suggestions in a dropdown.

Step-by-step behavior
1) User types a query into the box.
2) The component waits a short moment (debounce) so it doesn't send a request on every keystroke.
3) The component calls the server with the query and renders the returned suggestions in a dropdown.
4) Clicking a suggestion navigates to the matched user's profile or post.

Why debounce is used (simple)
- To avoid sending too many requests while the user is still typing; it groups rapid keystrokes into a single search call.

Testing steps
1. Type a common name and confirm the dropdown shows matching users.
2. Click a suggestion to ensure it navigates correctly.
3. Test empty input — dropdown should hide.

Developer notes
- Use a 200–400ms debounce for good UX.
- Consider adding keyboard navigation (arrow keys + Enter) for accessibility.
