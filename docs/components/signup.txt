Signup.jsx — Plain-language walkthrough for people new to coding

File path: `frontend/src/components/Signup.jsx`

What this file does (simple):
- Shows a form so a new person can create an account on the site. Think of it like signing up for a new email account — you provide a few details, and the site creates an account for you.

What a user sees on the page:
- Fields for email, password, confirm password, and usually a display name.
- A Submit (Sign Up) button.
- Helpful error messages if something is missing or incorrect.

Step-by-step: what happens when a person signs up
1) The user fills the form
	- They type their email and password into input boxes. The page may check the email looks valid (it contains an `@`) or that the password is long enough.

2) The user clicks Sign Up
	- The browser sends a message to the server saying: "Create a new user with this email and password".
	- This message is called an HTTP POST request.

3) The server replies
	- If everything is okay, the server creates the account and usually sends back a piece of information called a token (this is like a temporary key that proves you're logged in).
	- If there is a problem (email already used, weak password), the server sends back an error message and the page shows it to the user.

4) On success
	- The app saves the token (so you stay logged in) and usually navigates you to the main page.

Why the code checks fields on the client
- Doing simple checks (like whether the passwords match) prevents unnecessary network requests and gives faster feedback to the user.

Simple analogies
- Signing up is like filling a membership form at a club and receiving a membership card (the token). The app keeps your card until you log out.

Common beginner issues and how to fix them
- "I clicked sign up and nothing happened" → Check for visible validation messages (like "passwords don't match"). Open the browser console (Advanced) to see network errors.
- "Email already exists" → Use the password reset or choose a different email.

How to test the Signup flow (step-by-step for beginners)
1. Open the Signup page.
2. Fill with a valid email and a password that meets the rules (e.g., 6+ characters).
3. Click Sign Up and confirm you are redirected to the home page or a welcome screen.
4. Try to sign up again with the same email — the server should return an error and the page should show a friendly message.

Technical notes for maintainers (brief)
- The component often uses `axios` to send a POST request to `/api/v1/auth/signup`.
- On success the server returns a token and user object; the client stores that in Redux or localStorage and navigates to the app.

Where to go next
- `docs/components/login.txt` — explains how returning users sign in and how tokens are used to keep a session.
