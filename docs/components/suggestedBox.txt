SuggestedBox.jsx — Beginner-friendly guide

File path: frontend/src/components/SuggestedBox.jsx
Purpose: Shows a curated list of users the app thinks you might want to follow. Usually appears in the right sidebar or as a small card.

What the user sees
- A short list: thumbnail avatar, username, and a Follow button next to each suggestion.

How it works in plain language
1) The app asks the server: "Who might this user want to follow?"
2) The server returns a list of candidate users (based on following overlap, popularity, or other heuristics).
3) The SuggestedBox renders these results; clicking Follow sends a request to follow that user.

Why this is helpful
- Helps users discover others and grow the social graph so the feed has more interesting content.

Simple testing steps
1. Open the page with suggestions and confirm the list is populated.
2. Click Follow on one suggestion and see the UI update to show the user is now followed.

Developer notes
- Keep suggestions lightweight and consider pagination if the list is long.
- Debounce follow button clicks to avoid double requests.
