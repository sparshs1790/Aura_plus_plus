Comment.jsx — Line-by-line, word-by-word explanation (for beginners)

File: frontend/src/components/Comment.jsx
Goal: Explain every meaningful line so a new coder (or child) can understand how the Comment component shows one comment.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Avatar, AvatarFallback, AvatarImage } from './ui/avatar'
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```
- import React from 'react': Brings the React library so we can write components.
- Avatar, AvatarFallback, AvatarImage: small building blocks used to show a user's profile picture.
- Link: a clickable link that changes the page without reloading.

```jsx
const Comment = ({ comment }) => {
    return (
        <div className='my-2'>
            <div className='flex gap-3 items-center'>
                <Avatar>
                    <Link to={`/profile/${comment?.author?._id}`}>
                      <AvatarImage src={comment?.author?.profilePicture} />
                    </Link>
                    <Link to={`/profile/${comment?.author?._id}`}>
                      <AvatarFallback>
                        <img src={comment?.author?.profilePicture || '/profile.jpeg'} alt="default" className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                      </AvatarFallback>
                    </Link>
                </Avatar>
               <Link to={`/profile/${comment?.author?._id}`}>
                   <h1 className='font-bold text-sm'>{comment?.author?.username || 'Unknown'} <span className='font-normal pl-1'>{comment?.text}</span></h1>
               </Link>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Comment
```

Line-by-line explanation of the JSX block (rendered HTML-like structure)
- const Comment = ({ comment }) => { ... }
  - Defines a small function (component) called Comment.
  - It expects to receive one thing: an object named 'comment' that has author and text.

- <div className='my-2'>
  - The outer box that gives some vertical space (Tailwind 'my-2' means margin on top and bottom).

- <div className='flex gap-3 items-center'>
  - Inside, we use a row layout (flex) with a small gap and centered items.

- <Avatar> ... </Avatar>
  - This wraps the user's picture. Inside Avatar we have an image and a fallback.

- <Link to={`/profile/${comment?.author?._id}`}>
  - Makes the avatar clickable and sends the user to the comment author's profile page.
  - The expression `/profile/${comment?.author?._id}` builds a URL like `/profile/123` using the author's id.

- <AvatarImage src={comment?.author?.profilePicture} />
  - Attempts to load the author's picture using the URL stored in comment.author.profilePicture.
  - If this URL is empty or broken, the AvatarFallback below will be shown by the Avatar component.

- <AvatarFallback> <img src={...} /> </AvatarFallback>
  - As a backup, it shows a regular image element. The `|| '/profile.jpeg'` means: if author picture is missing, use `/profile.jpeg` as a default image.

- <h1 className='font-bold text-sm'>{comment?.author?.username || 'Unknown'} <span className='font-normal pl-1'>{comment?.text}</span></h1>
  - Shows the author's name in bold, and right after it, the comment text in normal font. If username is missing, it shows 'Unknown'.

- export default Comment
  - Makes this component available for other files to import and use.

Small notes for a child-like explanation
- Think of this component like a small card that shows who said something and what they said.
- It puts a photo (if available) next to the words so you can see the person who wrote the comment.
