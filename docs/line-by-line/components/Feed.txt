Feed.jsx — Line-by-line, word-by-word explanation (for beginners)

File: frontend/src/components/Feed.jsx
Goal: Explain each line so a beginner understands how the main Feed area shows posts.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Posts from './Posts'
```
- import React: brings React functionality.
- import Posts: bring the Posts component which renders a list of Post cards.

```jsx
const Feed = () => {
  return (
    <div className='flex-1 my-8 flex flex-col items-center pl-[20%]'>
        <Posts/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Feed
```

Line-by-line explanation
- const Feed = () => { ... }
  - Defines the Feed component as a small function that returns the main feed UI.

- <div className='flex-1 my-8 flex flex-col items-center pl-[20%]'>
  - A container with style classes (Tailwind CSS). These class names control spacing, layout, and padding:
    - 'flex-1' means this container expands to use available space.
    - 'my-8' adds vertical margin.
    - 'flex flex-col items-center' arranges inner elements vertically and centers them.
    - 'pl-[20%]' adds left padding of 20% (moves content away from left).

- <Posts/>
  - This is where the list of posts appears; Posts renders many Post components.

- export default Feed
  - Makes Feed usable by other parts of the app.

Child-friendly summary
- Feed is like the middle column of a social app where you scroll through pictures and posts. It just places the Posts component inside a nicely spaced box.
