Home.jsx — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/components/Home.jsx
Goal: Explain each line and punctuation so someone with no coding background can follow what the file does.

1) import React from 'react'
- import: bring something from another file or package.
- React: the main library used to build UI components.
- from 'react': indicates we take React from the 'react' package.

2) import Feed from './Feed'
- Import the Feed component from local file Feed.jsx in the same folder.
- './Feed' is a relative path: look in the same folder.

3) import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
- Outlet is a placeholder for nested routes in the app. When a child route is active, its component will render here.

4) import RightSideBar from './RightSideBar'
- Import the right sidebar component which shows suggested users and other widgets.

5) import useGetAllPost from '@/hooks/useGetAllPost'
- Custom hook that probably fetches all posts (runs some logic when invoked).
- '@/hooks/useGetAllPost' uses @ alias to root.

6) import useGetSuggestedUsers from '@/hooks/useGetSuggestedUsers'
- Custom hook to fetch suggested users for recommendations.

7) const Home = () => {
- Define the Home component as a function with no props.

8) useGetAllPost();
- Call the hook; when you call a hook it usually runs side effects (like fetching posts) and stores them in global state.
- No assignment is done because the hook handles data and updates itself (likely using Redux or context).

9) useGetSuggestedUsers();
- Call hook to fetch suggested users.

10) return (
    <div className='flex'>
- Return the JSX UI. <div className='flex'> is a container laid out with CSS flexbox.

11) <div className='flex-grow'>
- This inner div expands to use the remaining space.

12) <Feed />
- Place the Feed component (which shows posts) inside the main area.

13) <Outlet />
- Outlet is where nested route components will render (for example, a modal route or detail page).

14) </div>
- Close main flex-grow div.

15) <RightSideBar />
- Place the right sidebar component next to the main content.

16) </div>
- Close the outer flex container.

17) )
- Close return parentheses.

18) }
- Close Home function.

19) export default Home
- Make Home the default export so other files can import it with: import Home from './Home'

--- Simple summary for a child ---
- Home is like the main page of the app: it puts the feed (center) and a right-side column together.
- It also calls two helper functions that gather data for the feed and suggestions so the page shows up-to-date content.
