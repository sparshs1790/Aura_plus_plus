Posts.jsx — Line-by-line, word-by-word explanation (for beginners)

File: frontend/src/components/Posts.jsx
Goal: Explain every line so a new learner can understand how the app shows a list of posts.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Post from './Post'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
```
- import React: brings the React library.
- import Post: brings the Post component file we explained earlier.
- useSelector: a hook to read data from the app's global store (Redux).

```jsx
const Posts = () => {
  const {posts} = useSelector(store=>store.post);
  return (
    <div>
        {
            posts.map((post) => <Post key={post._id} post={post}/>)
        }
    </div>
  )
}

export default Posts
```

Line-by-line explanation
- const Posts = () => { ... }
  - Defines the Posts component as a function that returns UI.

- const {posts} = useSelector(store=>store.post);
  - Reads the 'posts' array from the Redux store under 'store.post'.
  - This array contains all posts the app knows about.

- return (<div> { posts.map(...) } </div>)
  - We create a container <div>.
  - Inside the div we run posts.map(...) which goes through each post in the array and turns it into a <Post /> component.
  - key={post._id} is required by React so it can track each list item; use a unique id like post._id.
  - post={post} passes the full post object to the Post component as a prop named 'post'.

- export default Posts
  - Makes Posts available for the rest of the app.

Child-friendly summary
- Think of Posts as a photo album page: it gets all photos (posts) from the app memory and shows each one using the Post card we explained earlier.
