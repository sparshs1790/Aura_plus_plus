ProtectedRoutes.jsx — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoutes.jsx
Goal: Explain how the app prevents unauthenticated users from accessing certain routes.

--- Top imports ---
1) import React from 'react'
- Import React.

2) import { Navigate, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'
- `Navigate` redirects to another route.
- `Outlet` renders nested routes when the user is allowed.

3) import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
- Hook to read authentication state from Redux.

--- Component ---
4) const ProtectedRoutes = () => {
- Define ProtectedRoutes component.

5) const { user } = useSelector(s => s.auth)
- Get `user` from auth slice. If `user` exists, the user is authenticated.

6) if (!user) { return <Navigate to='/login' replace /> }
- If there is no user, redirect to the `/login` page. `replace` avoids adding a history entry.

7) return <Outlet />
- If the user is authenticated, render the nested routes via `<Outlet />`.

8) export default ProtectedRoutes
- Export the component.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `ProtectedRoutes.jsx` blocks access when the user is not logged in by redirecting to `/login`; otherwise it allows the requested page to render.
