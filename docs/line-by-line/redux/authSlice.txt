authSlice.js — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/redux/authSlice.js
Goal: Explain how authentication state is represented and updated via Redux Toolkit slice.

--- Top imports ---
1) import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- `createSlice` is a helper from Redux Toolkit to define a reducer and its actions together.

--- Slice definition ---
2) const initialState = { user: null, token: null }
- The `initialState` has `user` (the authenticated user's data) and `token` (if used). Both start as null.

3) const authSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'auth',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        setAuthUser(state, action) { state.user = action.payload },
        clearAuth(state) { state.user = null; state.token = null }
    }
})
- `createSlice` creates action creators and reducer logic:
  - `setAuthUser` stores a user object into `state.user`.
  - `clearAuth` resets user and token to null.

4) export const { setAuthUser, clearAuth } = authSlice.actions
- Export the generated action creators so other parts of the app can dispatch `setAuthUser(user)`.

5) export default authSlice.reducer
- Export the reducer to be included in the Redux store.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `authSlice.js` centralizes auth state. Dispatch `setAuthUser(user)` to save a logged-in user or `clearAuth()` to log out.
