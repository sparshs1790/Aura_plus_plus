postSlice.js — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/redux/postSlice.js
Goal: Explain how posts are stored globally and how selection for the comment dialog is handled.

--- Top imports ---
1) import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- `createSlice` helps define reducer and actions.

--- Initial state ---
2) const initialState = { posts: [], selectedPost: null }
- `posts`: array of post objects.
- `selectedPost`: the post currently open in the CommentDialog or selected in the UI.

--- Slice ---
3) const postSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'post',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        setPosts(state, action) { state.posts = action.payload },
        setSelectedPost(state, action) { state.selectedPost = action.payload }
    }
})
- Reducers:
  - `setPosts`: sets the full posts array (used when fetching feed or user posts).
  - `setSelectedPost`: sets the currently selected post (used to open comments dialog).

4) export const { setPosts, setSelectedPost } = postSlice.actions
- Export action creators for use across the app.

5) export default postSlice.reducer
- Export reducer for the Redux store.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `postSlice` centralizes post data. Fetch posts and dispatch `setPosts(posts)`; to open a post's comments, dispatch `setSelectedPost(post)`.
