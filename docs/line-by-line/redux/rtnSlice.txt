rtnSlice.js — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/redux/rtnSlice.js
Goal: Explain the slice used for 'return' or app-level transient data — in this codebase it's used for suggested users and similar small bits of state.

--- Top imports ---
1) import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- `createSlice` to create reducers and actions.

--- Initial state ---
2) const initialState = { suggestedUsers: [] }
- `suggestedUsers`: an array holding recommended accounts for the current user.

--- Slice ---
3) const rtnSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'rtn',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        setSuggestedUsers(state, action) { state.suggestedUsers = action.payload }
    }
})
- Reducer `setSuggestedUsers` replaces the `suggestedUsers` array with new data.

4) export const { setSuggestedUsers } = rtnSlice.actions
- Export the action creator.

5) export default rtnSlice.reducer
- Export the reducer for inclusion in the store.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `rtnSlice` stores small app-level data like suggested users. Components and hooks dispatch `setSuggestedUsers` after fetching suggestions from the server.
