socketSlice.js — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/redux/socketSlice.js
Goal: Explain how socket connection state is represented so components can access the socket instance via Redux.

--- Top imports ---
1) import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- `createSlice` is used to create a Redux slice which bundles reducer logic and action creators.

--- Initial state ---
2) const initialState = { socket: null }
- The slice holds a `socket` property which will store the socket client instance (for example, a socket.io client).

--- Slice definition ---
3) const socketSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'socket',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        setSocket(state, action) { state.socket = action.payload },
        clearSocket(state) { state.socket = null }
    }
})
- Reducers provided:
  - `setSocket`: store a socket instance on the state so other parts of the app can read/use it.
  - `clearSocket`: remove the socket instance (useful on logout or cleanup).

4) export const { setSocket, clearSocket } = socketSlice.actions
- Export the generated action creators for other modules to dispatch.

5) export default socketSlice.reducer
- Export the reducer so it can be included in the Redux store configuration.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `socketSlice.js` centralizes the socket instance in Redux. Components or hooks can dispatch `setSocket(socket)` after creating a socket client, and read `state.socket.socket` (or use a selector) to access it.
