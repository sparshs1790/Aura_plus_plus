store.js — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/redux/store.js
Goal: Explain how the Redux store is configured and which slices are combined.

--- Top imports ---
1) import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
- `configureStore` is the recommended way to create a Redux store in Redux Toolkit. It sets up middleware and devtools automatically.

2) import authReducer from './authSlice'
3) import chatReducer from './chatSlice'
4) import postReducer from './postSlice'
5) import rtnReducer from './rtnSlice'
6) import socketReducer from './socketSlice'
- Import reducers (the default exports from each slice file) so they can be combined into the store.

--- Store creation ---
7) const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        auth: authReducer,
        chat: chatReducer,
                post: postReducer,
        rtn: rtnReducer,
        socket: socketReducer
    }
})
- `configureStore` accepts an object with a `reducer` field. Each key becomes a top-level slice in the Redux state.
- After this, `state.auth` holds the auth slice, `state.chat` holds chat data, etc.

8) export default store
- Export the configured store so the app can pass it to the `<Provider>` at the root and components can use `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `store.js` wires together the various slices into a single Redux store. Components use this store via React-Redux's `<Provider>` to access and update global state.
