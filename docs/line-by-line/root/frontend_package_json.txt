package.json (frontend) — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/package.json
Goal: Explain the frontend project's package.json: scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, and useful fields for running and building the app.

--- Top-level fields ---
1) {
- Start of JSON object.

2) "name": "frontend",
- Package name; helpful for identifying the project.

3) "version": "0.0.0",
- Semantic version of the project (often not critical for frontend apps in development).

4) "private": true,
- Prevents accidental publishing to npm.

--- Scripts ---
5) "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
}
- `dev`: starts the Vite dev server (hot reload, fast refresh).
- `build`: produces production build assets.
- `preview`: serves the production build locally for testing.

--- Dependencies / DevDependencies ---
6) "dependencies": { /* react, react-dom, react-router-dom, axios, tailwind, etc. */ }
- Lists runtime packages required by the app (React, router, axios, state libs, UI libs).

7) "devDependencies": { /* vite, eslint, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer, etc. */ }
- Lists development-only tools such as the bundler (Vite) and CSS tooling.

8) }
- End of JSON object.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `frontend/package.json` describes how to run the frontend (`npm run dev`) and which packages are needed. `vite` powers the dev experience and build tooling.
