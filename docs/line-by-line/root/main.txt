main.jsx — Line-by-line, token-level explanation (for absolute beginners)

File: frontend/src/main.jsx
Goal: Explain the app bootstrap: how React is mounted, how the router and Redux Provider are wired, and how global CSS and toasts are initialized.

--- Top imports ---
1) import React from 'react'
- Import React so JSX and React APIs are available.

2) import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
- ReactDOM's modern client API which provides `createRoot` to mount the app into the DOM.

3) import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
- `Provider` makes the Redux store available to all nested components via React context.

4) import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
- `BrowserRouter` enables client-side routing using the HTML5 history API.

5) import App from './App'
- The root App component which contains routes and layout.

6) import store from './redux/store'
- The configured Redux store (see `store.js`) passed into the `Provider`.

7) import './index.css'
- Global CSS entry (Tailwind or base styles) that applies across the app.

8) import NotificationToast from './components/NotificationToast'
- The toast container component which must be mounted once so any `toast` calls show messages.

--- Bootstrapping ---
9) const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
- Find the DOM node with id `root` (in `index.html`) and create a React root that controls it.

10) root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <Provider store={store}>
            <BrowserRouter>
                <App />
                <NotificationToast />
            </BrowserRouter>
        </Provider>
    </React.StrictMode>
)
- Render the app wrapped with `StrictMode` (helps find potential problems), `Provider` (Redux), and `BrowserRouter` (routing).
- `App` is the main component; `NotificationToast` is mounted alongside so toasts work anywhere.

11) End of file — the app is now mounted and running in the browser when the page loads.

--- Beginner summary ---
- `main.jsx` wires global providers (Redux/Router), mounts the React tree into the DOM, and includes global styles and a toast container.
